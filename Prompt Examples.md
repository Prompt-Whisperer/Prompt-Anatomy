# Prompt examples
### Text summarization
* Summarize articles and concepts into quick and easy-to-read summaries
* Example
   * Explain antibiotics A:
   * (The "A:" is an explicit prompt format that you use in question answering)
   * Chatbot response: Antibiotics are a type of medication used to treat bacterial infections. They work by either killing the bacteria or preventing them from reproducing, allowing the bodyâ€™s immune system to fight off the infection. Antibiotics are usually taken orally in the form of pills, capsules, or liquid solutions, or sometimes administered intravenously. They are not effective against viral infections, and using them inappropriately can lead to antibiotic resistance.
   * Explain the above in one sentence:
### Information Extraction
* Author-contribution statements and acknowledgements in research papers should state clearly and specifically whether, and to what extent, the authors used AI technologies such as ChatGPT in the preparation of their manuscript and analysis. They should also indicate which LLMs were used. This will alert editors and reviewers to scrutinize manuscripts more carefully for potential biases, inaccuracies and improper source crediting. Likewise, scientific journals should be transparent about their use of LLMs, for example when selecting submitted manuscripts. Mention the large language model based product mentioned in the paragraph above: 
### Question Answering
* A prompt could combine instructions, context, input, and output indicators to get improved results. While these components are not required, it becomes a good practice as the more specific you are with instruction, the better results you will get. Below is an example of how this would look following a more structured prompt.
* Example: Answer the question based on the context below. Keep the answer short and concise. Respond "Unsure about answer" if not sure about the answer. Context: Teplizumab traces its roots to a New Jersey drug company called Ortho Pharmaceutical. There, scientists generated an early version of the antibody, dubbed OKT3. Originally sourced from mice, the molecule was able to bind to the surface of T cells and limit their cell-killing potential. In 1986, it was approved to help prevent organ rejection after kidney transplants, making it the first therapeutic antibody allowed for human use. Question: What was OKT3 originally sourced from? Answer:
### Text Classification
* You will also find that for harder use cases, just providing instructions won't be enough. This is where you need to think more about the context and the different elements you can use in a prompt. Other elements you can provide are input data or examples.
  * Example: Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive. Text: I think the food was okay. Sentiment:
* You gave the instruction to classify the text and the model responded with 'Neutral', which is correct. Nothing is wrong with this but let's say that what you really need is for the model to give the label in the exact format you want. So instead of Neutral, you want it to return neutral. 
  * Example: Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive. Text: I think the vacation is okay. Sentiment: neutral Text: I think the food was okay. Sentiment:
### Conversation
* Perhaps one of the more interesting things you can achieve with prompt engineering is instructing the LLM system on how to behave, its intent, and its identity. This is particularly useful when you are building conversational systems like customer service chatbots.
* Note how you are explicitly telling it how to behave through the instruction. This is sometimes referred to as role prompting.
  * Example: The following is a conversation with an AI research assistant. The assistant tone is technical and scientific.Human: Hello, who are you?
  * AI: Greeting! I am an AI research assistant. How can I help you today?
  * Human: Can you tell me about the creation of blackholes?
  * AI: Black holes are formed from the gravitational collapse of a massive star's core, typically following a supernova explosion, condensing the remaining material into a point of infinite density known as a singularity.
  * Our AI research assistant sounds a bit too technical, right? Okay, let's change this behavior and instruct the system to give more accessible answers.
* The following is a conversation with an AI research assistant. The assistant answers should be easy to understand even by primary school students.
* Human: Can you tell me about the creation of black holes?
* AI:* Sure! Black holes are made when a really big star explodes and the leftover part squishes down into a super tiny, super heavy point that can even pull in light!
### Code Generation
* LLMs are quite effective is code generation.
* First, let's try a simple program that greets the user.
  * Prompt: /*Ask the user for their name and say "Hello"*/
  * Output: let name = prompt("What is your name?");console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
* The example below shows how powerful LLMs can be with a little more effort in designing the prompts.
  * Prompt: """Table departments, columns = [DepartmentId, DepartmentName]Table students, columns = [DepartmentId, StudentId, StudentName]Create a MySQL query for all students in the Computer Science Department"""
  * Output: SELECT StudentId, StudentName FROM students WHERE DepartmentId IN (SELECT DepartmentId FROM departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'Computer Science');
### Reasoning 
* Perhaps one of the most difficult tasks for an LLM today is one that requires some form of reasoning.
  * Prompt: What is 9,000 * 9,000?
  * Output: 81,000,000
* Let's try something more difficult.
  * Prompt: The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. A:
  * Output No, the odd numbers in this group add up to an odd number: 119.
* That's incorrect! Let's try to improve this by improving the prompt.
  * Prompt: The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. Solve by breaking the problem into steps. First, identify the odd numbers, add them, and indicate whether the result is odd or even.
  * Output: Odd numbers: 15, 5, 13, 7, 1Sum: 41 41 is an odd number.
